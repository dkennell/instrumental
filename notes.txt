Instrumental Notes  =
=====================

Project Status
---------------
  ==Overall Strategy
    - Find out who my instructor is for this project
    - Write up an overview of what we expect to be a
    passable website. Include a section of concerns,
    questions, contradictions in the rubric, etc.
    Once we know who the instructor is, send that shit.
    - Once message is sent, begin work, using current
    strategy.
    - Harrass instructor, send a message every other
    day. 
  ==Not Done Yet
    - Add link from new rental page to instrument index
  ==Debugs
    - Make sure that instruments that are currently being 
    rented cannot be removed from a rental by another user
    selecting the same instrument from the instrument list
    - It seems that some rentals might be gettting created
    without a user id, and this can lead to issues with the 'featured user' section.
    - Get rid of "accessories" attribute for instruments
